##Definition of the Problem
The mobile gaming industry has been considered as the worst part of the gaming industry by most of the gaming population, to the extent that mobile gamers in general are not regarded as actual gamers. However there is potential for mobile gaming platforms to take off if the mobile gaming market has more decent games. 

We aim to provide an enriching and enjoyable experience for people of all ages in their free time when they only gaming platform available is their mobile device. We feel that mobile gaming has the same potential as traditional gaming.

We hope to be able to bring out the best of mobile gaming and show to the world that it can be as good as any other forms of gaming.

#Milestones
By Milestone 1, we have a working prototype of our project. A demo of the app can be reached in this page tagged as `v0.1`. Currently implemented features are basic 2D platformer physics for the player and automatic camera following the player around the play area as the player moves around.

By Milestone 2, we have done the death mechanics, implemented the melee enemy that patrols around the map. We have also finished up on a basic character switching. We have completed 5 levels, chapter 1 has 4 levels and it takes place in a wooded area, with moving platforms and several obstacles to cross before meeting a boss at the final level while the first level of chapter 2 takes place in a town. A demo of this app can be reached in this page under `releases` tagged as `v0.2`, here the exe file you open has levels 1-1 to 2-1, with 1-4 being the boss level as mentioned above. Levels can be changed by pressing the "Change level" button on the top right hand corner or by reaching the end goal with the flag.
