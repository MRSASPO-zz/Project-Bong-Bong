#Project-Bong-Bong
Project Bong Bong (placeholder name at the moment) is a mobile game that is built using Unity. It is a 2D beat-em-up/platformer game that pits the player against different enemies and bosses spanning over different stages. 

#Project Ideation
##User stories
The user stories are all tracked inside our Issues tracker page, to view all the user stories type `is:issue is:open label:"type: stories"` under the issue's filter page, user stories are being prioritised as follows, the label `priority: high` denotes a must have features, while the label `priority: medium` is a good-to-have feature and the label `priority: low` shows features to be considered in the future.

##Definition of the Problem
The mobile gaming industry has been considered as the worst part of the gaming industry by most of the gaming population, to the extent that mobile gamers in general are not regarded as actual gamers. However there is potential for mobile gaming platforms to take off if the mobile gaming market has more decent games. 

We aim to provide an enriching and enjoyable experience for people of all ages in their free time when they only gaming platform available is their mobile device. We feel that mobile gaming has the same potential as traditional gaming.

We hope to be able to bring out the best of mobile gaming and show to the world that it can be as good as any other forms of gaming.

#Features Planned to be done by the next milestone
* 2D platform physics to be done (Including but not limited to moving platforms, wall jumps, slopes, "dangerous" obstacles) - Done except for "dangerous" obstacles.
* Enemies and basic enemy AI (At least melee units with simple collisions mechanics)
* Death mechanics for player and enemies
* Switching mechanics between the 3 available player characters

#Proposed Level of Achievement
The level of achievement that we are aiming for is `Project: Gemini`, here we list the requirements as stated below:

##Vostok
* Attend the liftoff workshop
* Log in at least 130 hours each
* Participate in Splashdown
* Create a basic web app with CRUD capabilities
* Complete peer evaluation exercises
* Show progress over 3 months

##Gemini
* Used an alternative platform: Unity (Milestone 1)
* Achievements
* Avatars
* Game notifier to tell gamers how much of the game is completed

#Milestones
By Milestone 1, we have a working prototype of our project. A demo of the app can be reached in this page tagged as `v0.1`. Currently implemented features are basic 2D platformer physics for the player and automatic camera following the player around the play area as the player moves around.

By Milestone 2, we plan to start on the implementation of death mechanics and 2 different enemy types, 1 ranged and 1 melee. In addition, we also plan to do basic pathfinding for these enemies. Also we plan to do 2 bosses with differing mechanics.
